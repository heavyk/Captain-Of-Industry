# accomplishments

### discovered and filled ship with wood

important to accomplish before running out of acessable wood.

### importing crude from oil rig

temporary until contract is setup. oil rigs have tons of crude, so this can go for a while.

### importing wood from sawmill

until this happens, the ship is sorta land-locked. using more than 100/m of wood, I only have enough wood for a trip to the sawmill and back. this frees up shippy-ship to do explore and fight.

### vp2 for iron contract

important to build a factory that smelts its own iron and and processes it into VP2 (the glass production good for getting rid of sand)

### vp2 for crude contract

once vp2 for iron is done, it's good to build a refinery near to it and also process the crude.

### sustainable island

can let the game run for an x number of years and the island will still have as many or more resources as when accomplishing this.

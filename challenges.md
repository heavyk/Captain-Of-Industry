# challenges

### groundwater pump limit

jump straight to basic distillers, and get large quantites of fresh water the old fashioned way (rainwater and distillation). reason is, I don't know that smallish islands like the ones in coi would even have groundwater resouces. I would actually expect it to all contain some quantity of salt. either way, it makes for an interesting challenge.

### abnormal resource sizes

I find that larger resources is actually more difficult because I almost never use all of the resources. when playing `b-` (beach), I noticed that it was easier to import iron from the contract than it was to mine it. I actually found it kind of annoying that I had to get rid of all of that iron and sand. in ysnp, when setting the resources sizes to smallest, there's a whole lot more room to build farms in the centre, and on the breach, there aren't these mountains of sand that have to be cleared to put stuff on the right side. I consider larger resources (especially when at higher elevation), I find this harder to deal with.

### abnormal resource hight

I find that on some maps with limited space like ysnp, having the resources higher up can block or occupy previous space. for example, on ysnp, this can cause parts of the right-side beach to be unpassable with limestone veins blocking the way. also, it can take longer to flatten the beach. additionally, it's more difficult to make space for a cargo dock (especially with shallow ocean incline)

### abnormal forest sizes

for most maps this doesn't matter so much, but on ysnp, having to clear a forest is really difficult. in fact, I'd say it makes the game significantly hader. for `q-` I reduced its size to make things easier cause trees are easy to get from the sawmill.

### clear blue seas

don't dump waste into the sea. I dump it on the ground temporarily, then burn it later. I just don't like the way it looks having a factory (or JD's slum housing) sitting on top waste. I want it to look clean and green, so I just dump rock into the sea (cept on the beach, where it'll eventually get dug out again)

### waste not want not

use up all the resources on the island. in combination with "clear blue seas", this means that *all* resources must mined out and aldo turned into something else.

# README

I intend to put various captain of the industry things related. the game has inspired such a flurry of thought for me that I want to begin to organise it.

### save format

I'm still experimenting with the format for save files. I'm between two designs still. most of the saves either don't have a format or are useing one of these.

#### code- x.y.z-n - feature

`x` is the major version of the map. I think of the map as a build order, so I kinda have a flow in my mind of things that need to be accomplished. each `y` is a major version in that system, and `x` are just incremental saves along the way which may be only a few months apart. `n` features are small changes that were made to the save file without unpausing the game (like forgot to turn something on)

#### code- subsystems - x.y.z-n

in this one, I for the map, I have different subsystems, which have sort of like milestones to them. I set out to build certain objectives in the form of subsections. for example, on the map yshnp, I've found that a basic distillery in the back is good for getting things started, but then I want to build a simple adv diesel system, but later I want an 8x adv diesel system (those are version 1, 2, and 3). for production, I found that 8 factories in a row is good. this is a good investment for my cp2 early on because I'll have a lot of time and trees to kill, and makes future expansion faster with enhanced cp production.

the thing I notice with this one is when I look at the saves list after loading a save, I can't really figure out where I am. I'm thinking about adding at least the year and perhaps month.

#### code- yyyy.m feature

this is the format I'm using for the latest incarnation of q- I find it a lot easier to see what save I'm doing, going by year. I do want to incorporate a branch into it, so probably I'll make all of them mainline, then branch off with a different code.

## new haven

hated it from the first time I played it. played it again with jaron the one time, and even though it was on sailor, it was still too easy and gave me a weird vibe I didn't like. it felt like I was connected to the other noobs that are looking at "such a complex game" and can't figure out what is fun about moving sand around on an unbelievably contrived map. the map is contrived, but not in a good way like crater or ysnp.

## circular

I can't remember, but I think it was too easy so I ditched it.

## crater

I loved this map, but I can't tell it to go at a height *above the terrain* so it's not like the belt/pipe would follow the terrain (like a roller-coaster). as such, it was impossible to do ramps. when ramps and building on s slope is reworked, I really want to revisit this map. it gives me such a good vibe and I just love tunneling down deep into a coal mine to get to a farming sort of flatland. in my imagination, I picture the piace a little more jungly, so I'm like passing this cool lookout point and then descending down this coal mine into the lush gardens (greenhouse 2) downstairs.

I think this is my favourite map for layout and difficulty because of the difficult placement andr long distance between iron/coal and copper.

## c-

my first attempt at ysnp. I got pretty far and am pretty stable. things are pretty fine and I can win the map if I take it a bit slower. I have hundreds of years on the crude deposits to get the vp2 for crude setup on the beach. I'll probably take the whole thing down to 1 and then lay a layer of rock so it looks nice and has sharp ocean edges.

in this one (my 1-2nd attempt), I mainly didn't do a whole lot of loading. I played through trying to save and load more. I really like how it is when I just go through and play it. I'm really starting to like just freestyling it, not really planning too much and just going for it. this is the play style that I'll eventually adopt. the replay mode is good for practise, but it's a lot of fun to just go for hours without saving or loading. it's kinda like freedom. my goal is to get a build order such that I can kinda just execute it. the game isn't really ready for this style of play yet, because some of the more common tasks are still quite tedius

## p-

my second attempt at ysnp (or is it third). this is about the time that I wanted to get a more solid early game technique. I played this map on -20% forest and admiral difficulty. the forest was actually to make it easier. at normal bush, it takes FOREVER to give the inner section there a brazillian. everyone loves a shaved map. so, I reduce the forest to clear up space real quickly. it's pretty easy to import wood from the sawmill.

## p- (named the same until I sort them)

this is the one I'm playing now. it's probably at least the 4th attempt. I wanted to focus on my perhformance and technique. in this one and in crater, I would go along saving (not frequently) and just see how far I could get before it fell apart. this one, I"m trying to optimise my CP prodruction, because a build needs to flow, and I can't have large gaps where I can't build something cause I don't have parts. this means I work on more things at once, doing smaller incremental improvements.

the short term goals are to bring the whole inner section down to 2 and haul the dirt out to the front and make a dock on the side there (dirt) and use rock to make some piers on the beach to the left. I'll dig it out and consume the sand for a massive glass + VP2 (for crude) and a good construction parts setup. on the left there I'll be throwing the mountain into the sea and building a sour water, hydrogen and electronics setup there. OH right, and because there is so much gold, I'm just gonna go heavy gold mining for crude on the left side.

#### left side

- gold for crude
- slag for sour water -> hydrogen and quartz and then later microprocessors.
- settlement will rely mostly on chickens and sausages because they're easy to make.
- diesel installation to turn crude mostly into FG. all extras get turned into FG anyway, and I plan to run quite a large diesel setup here, importing lots and lots of crude (for gold), and it'll power lots and lots of power plants with that FG -> hydrogen, and then because I have lots of people (dual--or triple if I don't aboandon the original), I'm going to turn all of that depeleated steam into water. people and farms are thirsty, so they can drink the hydrogen that powers their household appliances. lots of diesel to turn into lots of hydrogen.

#### right side

- VP2 for crude. huge iron production facility. it'll have redundant copper production, but mostly just to not have to import from the left side. they'll also have HA for copper (for their settlement and for getting copper)
- also slag for sour water
- this one will probably also do chickens, because they're very efficient for many peole they feed. with fertilizer, 4-6 greenhouses can feed probably 10k people with chickens. that's only 200-300 water and then anther 200-300, so not much. easy to make, again from the power to water idea. it's more cost effective to use desal for water, considering that people, with a proper food setup are really not a problem at all. high population good.
- dunno, other stuff

the resume is that the beach side is gonna be heavy into iron and construction parts (cause of limestone and sand), the gold side into gold, oil, and microprocessors.

#### front centre

- I'll probably keep this little settlement. I don't intend for it to grow beyond 800 or so. it'll probably spread toward the left there. the part back of the coal mine is where I want to put the second settlement, becasue it'll probably grow bigger.
- the rest of the island will run off of contracts importing all of the things that it needs, but I intend to keep this section around (paused) with mining reserves to be able to bail out if contracts don't work or something.
  - in reality, this a fanciful idea because I'll obviously reload the save, instead of activate an emergency failsafe. it's fun for me to play the game as if there are additional stresses, as if this was the production for a larger military operation. as such, in such "real-life" situations, a loading isn't possible so I have to have these back procedures. also when I played without loading so much, I had techniques to bail myself out of situations.

## q- restart to see bricks mechanic

I restarted the game to try out the new bricks mechanic deployed in 0.4.13. it's nice that I don't have to dump dirt anymore and can turn all my dirt into bricks. I'll save my slag and turn it into sour water later with the contract.

the plan is to setup bricks and dirt to run as a backup to the concrete system. I'm going to try and run a lot of it off of bricks allowing me to get rid of dirt a lot easier. concrete is nice though because it gets rid of slag turning them into bricks. for every iron ore smelted, half of it turns into slag, so until recycling is online a lot of extra slag is created. this is good for creating concrete, and then later little slag is output, cause scrap doesn't create slag. that's the plan so far.

I these are the map settings I decided on (difficulty admiral)

![q starting configuration](img/q-settings.png)

while playing with these settings, I noticed is that normal elevation, the top part is at 45. this is pretty high. -25% reduced cliff heights, it's at 34 -- too easy I think. max hight I think bas 65 or 66 -- really high, and the back part of the inner area isn't even accessible and the coal needs to be mined out to even access it. I think this setting is pretty close to impossible. I wanna beat these setting first before trying that one -- I'm not *that* ambitious :).

strat changes from how I did p-:

- I will make the ramp up to the next level, now do diagonally up in iron mountain.
- I set the farms more over to the right, cause once I clear the mountain to the left, I'll have space to put in chicken farms that will feed enough that the settlement should be able to expand to 2-3k without a problem (with food saver edict, I'm actually thinking 5k+).
- instead of dumping dirt into the sea, I'm going to use it to make bricks. I'll accumulate slag, and then trade it for sour water later
- I'm going to try and not dump anything but rock into the ocean. I'm also going to try and dig up and consume all of the dirt too (only rock island eventually).
- I'm going for sustainable island, so removing all resources isn't my immediate goal, but it would be cool to realise an only rock island (minus the single layer of dirt below the farms)

gameplan:
- I'm going to first shave the entire middle part down to 5 (removing the dirt), then to 2 (removing the rock and expanding the copper smelters into electronics 2). all dirt will be used to to create bricks, and the rock to make a pier in front of the settlement. this is going to be the strat for the entire top part as well. the goal is to take all of the dirt and turn it into bricks and just use the rock to expand the island outward
- I'll ramp up to the top and shave the entire top of the map down to 40 (from 45) using all of the dirt to create bricks.
- I'll then use all of the extra rock to expand the whole island out laterally.
- parts of the island in the middle will still have dirt. that will get dug out (along with all the resources) and replaced with rock.
- final product will be a fully rock island with a massive factory.
- I want to make at least 2 settlements (one on the left and one on the right) -- but it's possible I'll be keeping the initial one in the centre there.

### 2022-12-31 18:00 - initial thoughts on new bricks mechanic

I really like it. in previous playthroughs, I didn't really know what to do with all of the dirt, so I threw it into the sea. the bricks maker requires quite a lot of maintenance (twice as much as cement) and makes half/quarter/eighth as many bricks for input (6 vs 12/24/48) so it's quite inefficient, and somewhat expensive to create, but I *really like* not having to transport the dirt all the way across the map to throw it in the sea. I'm even thinking of creating little bricks factories on to reduce the transport, because it's easy to get water and coal, and turning 12 dirt into 6 bricks nearly halves (minus coal) the amount of materials needed to be transported by the trucks.

### 2022-12-31 18:21 - performance metrics

the other day, I was thinking about taking my save files and making them into a website where other people can upload their saves, and then the save file is parsed to extract some data from it to show metrics. (kinda in speedrunning fashion)

at the moment, I'm using cp1 production as my performance metric (cause it's used for all construction). I want it to be constantly positive (ie how well the build flows), and have the biggest numbers (ie how efficient it is). for the website I want to display these numbers visually and comparatively to other saves -- so I'll take the statistics recorded in the save file and use them to calculate efficient build orders, and allow others to upload their saves and improve on existing ones. as more alternate routes get taken, I'd also like to show the saves in a network graph of branches with their efficiency.

for example, last night I did a build, and it became pretty productive, but I ran into a hiccup where I don't have space for another copper smelter and no space for iron either. so, I'm gonna prioritise mining those out tonight and see where I get.

in y69.8 I have 19479 cp1 production. which seems pretty good considering the map and difficulty, but I think I can do better. just letting the game run pretty much until y78.9 I had 21923. again, pretty good, but I think I can do better. I think I'm going to start over in y62.5 which has 16237 cp1. (I have the abandoned branch with those metrics saved somewhere if anyone wants them)

### 2023-01-01 04:21 - starting tech3

next things:
- sulfur to slag
- upgrade to assumbler 2 to save power and pops
- add another steel smelter (when the iron mountain is out of way)
- add second air separator and use nitrogen to make science2
- I'm mining more coal than I'm using. put an alarm and move over a digger to get rid of dirt on top of coal mine

I'm thinking, actually if I'm this close to t3, then I may as well just put up with the crappy diggers and research glass instead of trading cp3 for it.

I did make last night's production graph a lot smoother (though only slightly improved numbers), so I may want to improve it again tomorrow (y75-80 are kinda rough cause I had bricks/iron production problems). we'll see.

at any rate, I'm feeling really good about this run because I think I'm ~50y years faster getting tech3. I also still have 1/3 of crude oil reserve left too. it'll go fast as soon as I upgrade trucks.

(I think I'm also going to move this log over to a separate file tomorrow as well, clean it up a bit too). btw, I'm starting to keep logs of a lot more things now because I'm having such a difficult time remembering things, and I've found that writing it down improves  my recollection of it and also it's really helpful to be able to look back and search it.

### 2023-01-01 17:14 - I am so stoned

I'm just recording this, because I'll have to look at it tomorrow and I think around y75-76 I got *really stoned* and I don't think that it's going quite as smoothely as it normally does. I don't normally experience this, which is why I'm stopping -- is I'm starting to worry. I never worry when I'm playing, so I know it's a problem. I'm clearly picking up interference from elsewhere -- what's important though is that I recognise it.

this game is extremely mental in that I notice that even a little bit of tiredness really affects me, which is why I'm starting to redo (now that I'm looking at things as a sequence) the last few years. what I mean is, when I wake up in the morning, my mind is fresh so I see the game usually a lot clearer than when I'm shutting down the game at 2-4am. I often times notice a whole lot of things I could do better and so what I do is redo the last few years -- just sorta start over.

there's a tremendous value to throwing things away. I learned this from andreas. he said he had a friend that would write a prototype and then just throw away the prototype and start over. I recognised this as valuable when I was programming myself, because I learned so much from the next time that I do it -- the rewrite. the thing is, you don't want to rewrite all sections, but I noticed it was a good idea to just start over and write all the code again manually. it's a bit more effort, but for example when I would watch dominic (tarr) or substack (james haliday?) they would start over with a nodejs server ... you know starting the file from empty, importing net, fs, etc. and then just starting there to show it off. they'd done so many presentations, the basic setup they figured out really well.

anyway, well, I take the same approach to this game. I like to think of my factories as accumulating technical debt with all of the pipe spaghetti. there are always more optimal ways to lay things out and stuff. there are also improvements that I can do on the timeline.

the timeline is like this lightning bolt passing through a medium. it tries in one way, goes a long enough distance to encounter enough resistance to know it doesn't want to go forward any more, so it goes back a ways and retries. every night, I try to go back and redo a few things here and there, and then during the day, I often times restart after a fail moment or I want to imporove it. each of creates a different branch. the more branches that one takes from a point, they spread out, in incompoatibility/difference to each other (more difference, more distance) in kinda a cone shape. the end result is what it looks like when lightning is passing through a medium. it's finding its least resistant path to the destination. I've always seen this as the leader.

after connection is made, now you have a timeline from start to finish, and now it's possible to go back on the timeline and redo the same things a little bit differently, creating even more branches. the more branches that are created, eventually this is a straight line -- a sequency of operations to get from one point to another point.

break time. man the scorpions are insane.

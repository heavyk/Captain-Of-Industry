# README

I intend to put various captain of the industry things related. the game has inspired such a flurry of thought for me that I want to begin to organise it.

### save format

I'm still experimenting with the format for save files. I'm between two designs still. most of the saves either don't have a format or are useing one of these.

#### code- x.y.z-n - feature

`x` is the major version of the map. I think of the map as a build order, so I kinda have a flow in my mind of things that need to be accomplished. each `y` is a major version in that system, and `x` are just incremental saves along the way which may be only a few months apart. `n` features are small changes that were made to the save file without unpausing the game (like forgot to turn something on)

#### code- subsystems - x.y.z-n

in this one, I for the map, I have different subsystems, which have sort of like milestones to them. I set out to build certain objectives in the form of subsections. for example, on the map yshnp, I've found that a basic distillery in the back is good for getting things started, but then I want to build a simple adv diesel system, but later I want an 8x adv diesel system (those are version 1, 2, and 3). for production, I found that 8 factories in a row is good. this is a good investment for my cp2 early on because I'll have a lot of time and trees to kill, and makes future expansion faster with enhanced cp production.

the thing I notice with this one is when I look at the saves list after loading a save, I can't really figure out where I am. I'm thinking about adding at least the year and perhaps month.

#### code- yyyy.m feature

this is the format I'm using for the latest incarnation of q- I find it a lot easier to see what save I'm doing, going by year. I do want to incorporate a branch into it, so probably I'll make all of them mainline, then branch off with a different code.

## new haven

hated it from the first time I played it. played it again with jaron the one time, and even though it was on sailor, it was still too easy and gave me a weird vibe I didn't like. it felt like I was connected to the other noobs that are looking at "such a complex game" and can't figure out what is fun about moving sand around on an unbelievably contrived map. the map is contrived, but not in a good way like crater or ysnp.

## circular

I can't remember, but I think it was too easy so I ditched it.

## crater

I loved this map, but I can't tell it to go at a height *above the terrain* so it's not like the belt/pipe would follow the terrain (like a roller-coaster). as such, it was impossible to do ramps. when ramps and building on s slope is reworked, I really want to revisit this map. it gives me such a good vibe and I just love tunneling down deep into a coal mine to get to a farming sort of flatland. in my imagination, I picture the piace a little more jungly, so I'm like passing this cool lookout point and then descending down this coal mine into the lush gardens (greenhouse 2) downstairs.

I think this is my favourite map for layout and difficulty because of the difficult placement andr long distance between iron/coal and copper.

## c-

my first attempt at ysnp. I got pretty far and am pretty stable. things are pretty fine and I can win the map if I take it a bit slower. I have hundreds of years on the crude deposits to get the vp2 for crude setup on the beach. I'll probably take the whole thing down to 1 and then lay a layer of rock so it looks nice and has sharp ocean edges.

in this one (my 1-2nd attempt), I mainly didn't do a whole lot of loading. I played through trying to save and load more. I really like how it is when I just go through and play it. I'm really starting to like just freestyling it, not really planning too much and just going for it. this is the play style that I'll eventually adopt. the replay mode is good for practise, but it's a lot of fun to just go for hours without saving or loading. it's kinda like freedom. my goal is to get a build order such that I can kinda just execute it. the game isn't really ready for this style of play yet, because some of the more common tasks are still quite tedius

## p-

my second attempt at ysnp (or is it third). this is about the time that I wanted to get a more solid early game technique. I played this map on -20% forest and admiral difficulty. the forest was actually to make it easier. at normal bush, it takes FOREVER to give the inner section there a brazillian. everyone loves a shaved map. so, I reduce the forest to clear up space real quickly. it's pretty easy to import wood from the sawmill.

## p- (named the same until I sort them)

this is the one I'm playing now. it's probably at least the 4th attempt. I wanted to focus on my perhformance and technique. in this one and in crater, I would go along saving (not frequently) and just see how far I could get before it fell apart. this one, I"m trying to optimise my CP prodruction, because a build needs to flow, and I can't have large gaps where I can't build something cause I don't have parts. this means I work on more things at once, doing smaller incremental improvements.

the short term goals are to bring the whole inner section down to 2 and haul the dirt out to the front and make a dock on the side there (dirt) and use rock to make some piers on the beach to the left. I'll dig it out and consume the sand for a massive glass + VP2 (for crude) and a good construction parts setup. on the left there I'll be throwing the mountain into the sea and building a sour water, hydrogen and electronics setup there. OH right, and because there is so much gold, I'm just gonna go heavy gold mining for crude on the left side.

#### left side

- gold for crude
- slag for sour water -> hydrogen and quartz and then later microprocessors.
- settlement will rely mostly on chickens and sausages because they're easy to make.
- diesel installation to turn crude mostly into FG. all extras get turned into FG anyway, and I plan to run quite a large diesel setup here, importing lots and lots of crude (for gold), and it'll power lots and lots of power plants with that FG -> hydrogen, and then because I have lots of people (dual--or triple if I don't aboandon the original), I'm going to turn all of that depeleated steam into water. people and farms are thirsty, so they can drink the hydrogen that powers their household appliances. lots of diesel to turn into lots of hydrogen.

#### right side

- VP2 for crude. huge iron production facility. it'll have redundant copper production, but mostly just to not have to import from the left side. they'll also have HA for copper (for their settlement and for getting copper)
- also slag for sour water
- this one will probably also do chickens, because they're very efficient for many peole they feed. with fertilizer, 4-6 greenhouses can feed probably 10k people with chickens. that's only 200-300 water and then anther 200-300, so not much. easy to make, again from the power to water idea. it's more cost effective to use desal for water, considering that people, with a proper food setup are really not a problem at all. high population good.
- dunno, other stuff

the resume is that the beach side is gonna be heavy into iron and construction parts (cause of limestone and sand), the gold side into gold, oil, and microprocessors.

#### front centre

- I'll probably keep this little settlement. I don't intend for it to grow beyond 800 or so. it'll probably spread toward the left there. the part back of the coal mine is where I want to put the second settlement, becasue it'll probably grow bigger.
- the rest of the island will run off of contracts importing all of the things that it needs, but I intend to keep this section around (paused) with mining reserves to be able to bail out if contracts don't work or something.
  - in reality, this a fanciful idea because I'll obviously reload the save, instead of activate an emergency failsafe. it's fun for me to play the game as if there are additional stresses, as if this was the production for a larger military operation. as such, in such "real-life" situations, a loading isn't possible so I have to have these back procedures. also when I played without loading so much, I had techniques to bail myself out of situations.

## q- restart to see bricks mechanic

I restarted the game to try out the new bricks mechanic deployed in 0.4.13. it's nice that I don't have to dump dirt anymore and can turn all my dirt into bricks. I'll save my slag and turn it into sour water later with the contract.

the plan is to setup bricks and dirt to run as a backup to the concrete system. I'm going to try and run a lot of it off of bricks allowing me to get rid of dirt a lot easier. concrete is nice though because it gets rid of slag turning them into bricks. for every iron ore smelted, half of it turns into slag, so until recycling is online a lot of extra slag is created. this is good for creating concrete, and then later little slag is output, cause scrap doesn't create slag. that's the plan so far.

I these are the map settings I decided on (difficulty admiral)

![q starting configuration](img/q-settings.png)

while playing with these settings, I noticed is that normal elevation, the top part is at 45. this is pretty high. -25% reduced cliff heights, it's at 34 -- too easy I think. max hight I think bas 65 or 66 -- really high, and the back part of the inner area isn't even accessible and the coal needs to be mined out to even access it. I think this setting is pretty close to impossible. I wanna beat these setting first before trying that one -- I'm not *that* ambitious :).

strat changes from how I did p-:

- I will make the ramp up to the next level, now do diagonally up in iron mountain.
- I set the farms more over to the right, cause once I clear the mountain to the left, I'll have space to put in chicken farms that will feed enough that the settlement should be able to expand to 2-3k without a problem (with food saver edict, I'm actually thinking 5k+).
- instead of dumping dirt into the sea, I'm going to use it to make bricks. I'll accumulate slag, and then trade it for sour water later
- I'm going to try and not dump anything but rock into the ocean. I'm also going to try and dig up and consume all of the dirt too (only rock island eventually).
- I'm going for sustainable island, so removing all resources isn't my immediate goal, but it would be cool to realise an only rock island (minus the single layer of dirt below the farms)

gameplan:
- I'm going to first shave the entire middle part down to 5 (removing the dirt), then to 2 (removing the rock and expanding the copper smelters into electronics 2). all dirt will be used to to create bricks, and the rock to make a pier in front of the settlement. this is going to be the strat for the entire top part as well. the goal is to take all of the dirt and turn it into bricks and just use the rock to expand the island outward
- I'll ramp up to the top and shave the entire top of the map down to 40 (from 45) using all of the dirt to create bricks.
- I'll then use all of the extra rock to expand the whole island out laterally.
- parts of the island in the middle will still have dirt. that will get dug out (along with all the resources) and replaced with rock.
- final product will be a fully rock island with a massive factory.
- I want to make at least 2 settlements (one on the left and one on the right) -- but it's possible I'll be keeping the initial one in the centre there.

### 2022-12-31 18:00 - initial thoughts on new bricks mechanic

I really like it. in previous playthroughs, I didn't really know what to do with all of the dirt, so I threw it into the sea. the bricks maker requires quite a lot of maintenance (twice as much as cement) and makes half/quarter/eighth as many bricks for input (6 vs 12/24/48) so it's quite inefficient, and somewhat expensive to create, but I *really like* not having to transport the dirt all the way across the map to throw it in the sea. I'm even thinking of creating little bricks factories on to reduce the transport, because it's easy to get water and coal, and turning 12 dirt into 6 bricks nearly halves (minus coal) the amount of materials needed to be transported by the trucks.

### 2022-12-31 18:21 - performance metrics

the other day, I was thinking about taking my save files and making them into a website where other people can upload their saves, and then the save file is parsed to extract some data from it to show metrics. (kinda in speedrunning fashion)

at the moment, I'm using cp1 production as my performance metric (cause it's used for all construction). I want it to be constantly positive (ie how well the build flows), and have the biggest numbers (ie how efficient it is). for the website I want to display these numbers visually and comparatively to other saves -- so I'll take the statistics recorded in the save file and use them to calculate efficient build orders, and allow others to upload their saves and improve on existing ones. as more alternate routes get taken, I'd also like to show the saves in a network graph of branches with their efficiency.

for example, last night I did a build, and it became pretty productive, but I ran into a hiccup where I don't have space for another copper smelter and no space for iron either. so, I'm gonna prioritise mining those out tonight and see where I get.

in y69.8 I have 19479 cp1 production. which seems pretty good considering the map and difficulty, but I think I can do better. just letting the game run pretty much until y78.9 I had 21923. again, pretty good, but I think I can do better. I think I'm going to start over in y62.5 which has 16237 cp1. (I have the abandoned branch with those metrics saved somewhere if anyone wants them)

### 2023-01-01 04:21 - starting tech3

next things:
- sulfur to slag
- upgrade to assumbler 2 to save power and pops
- add another steel smelter (when the iron mountain is out of way)
- add second air separator and use nitrogen to make science2
- I'm mining more coal than I'm using. put an alarm and move over a digger to get rid of dirt on top of coal mine

I'm thinking, actually if I'm this close to t3, then I may as well just put up with the crappy diggers and research glass instead of trading cp3 for it.

I did make last night's production graph a lot smoother (though only slightly improved numbers), so I may want to improve it again tomorrow (y75-80 are kinda rough cause I had bricks/iron production problems). we'll see.

at any rate, I'm feeling really good about this run because I think I'm ~50y years faster getting tech3. I also still have 1/3 of crude oil reserve left too. it'll go fast as soon as I upgrade trucks.

(I think I'm also going to move this log over to a separate file tomorrow as well, clean it up a bit too). btw, I'm starting to keep logs of a lot more things now because I'm having such a difficult time remembering things, and I've found that writing it down improves  my recollection of it and also it's really helpful to be able to look back and search it.

### 2023-01-01 17:14 - I am so stoned

I'm just recording this, because I'll have to look at it tomorrow and I think around y75-76 I got *really stoned* and I don't think that it's going quite as smoothely as it normally does. I don't normally experience this, which is why I'm stopping. I'm starting to worry. I never worry when I'm playing, so I know it's a problem. I'm clearly picking up interference from elsewhere -- what's important though is that I recognise it.

this game is extremely mental in that I notice that the way I feel really influences how I'm playing -- so that even a little bit of tiredness really affects me; which is why I'm starting to redo (now that I'm looking at things as a sequence) the last few years every morning. what I mean is, when I wake up in the morning, my mind is fresh so I see the game usually a lot clearer than when I'm shutting down the game at 2-4am. I often times notice a whole lot of things I could do better and so what I do is redo the last few years -- just sorta start over.

there's a tremendous value to throwing things away. I learned this from andreas. he said he had a friend that would write a prototype and then just throw away the prototype and start over. I recognised this as valuable when I was programming myself, because I learned so much from the next time that I do it -- the rewrite. the thing is, you don't want to rewrite all sections, but I noticed it was a good idea to just start over and write all the code again manually. it's a bit more effort, but for example when I would watch dominic (tarr) or substack (james haliday?) they would start over with a nodejs server ... you know starting the file from empty, importing net, fs, etc. and then just starting there to show it off. they'd done so many presentations, the basic setup they figured out really well.

anyway, well, I take the same approach to this game. I like to think of my factories as accumulating technical debt with all of the pipe spaghetti. there are always more optimal ways to lay things out and stuff. there are also improvements that I can do on the timeline.

the timeline is like this lightning bolt passing through a medium. it tries in one way, goes a long enough distance to encounter enough resistance to know it doesn't want to go forward any more, so it goes back a ways and retries. every night, I try to go back and redo a few things here and there, and then during the day, I often times restart after a fail moment or I want to imporove it. each of creates a different branch. the more branches that one takes from a point, they spread out, in incompoatibility/difference to each other (more difference, more distance) in kinda a cone shape. the end result is what it looks like when lightning is passing through a medium. it's finding its least resistant path to the destination. I've always seen this as the leader.

after connection is made, now you have a timeline from start to finish, and now it's possible to go back on the timeline and redo the same things a little bit differently, creating even more branches. the more branches that are created, eventually this is a straight line -- a sequence of operations to get from one point to another point.

break time. man the scorpions are insane.

### 2023-01-02 01:29 - worry

when I say worry, I mean thinking about the things that could go wrong. in fact, I don't think about what could go wrong at all. instead, I'm only tryiny to keep everything stable meanwhile building the next thing that I want. the only forward thinking that I have really is when I'm about to move the diggers, because I'll want to be clearing the next space for my next addition to the factory.

this time, I end now evaluating my progress by simply feeling like I'm definitely feeling good about how things are progressing.
I've almost got another steel smelter, which means I can start building the lvd. once I have medium diggers, it's a complete gamechanger, as now I'll be able to mine the iron ramp easily and clear out the mountains on the left side and use that new space next to the tech. making the space on the beach will be really good so that I can start on glass production. flatening the beach will put in a cargo depot which will do the coal for cement contract. keep expanding the beach and putting in rows of coal power plants. I have TONS of limestone to mine and with the contract basically unimited power and cement...

### 2023-01-02 04:06 - looking good

I went extra long before quitting here. I'm going to restart this one, but even with such a disaster, y89.5 and production is 32891. I'm feeling really confident that I can get fertilizer and large vehicles building in prolly by 85 or even sooner. we'll see.

### 2023-01-02 12:48 - omg what a disaster

I think I'll start over from y74.2-1. let's see how it goes.

### 2023-01-03 04:51 - fixed a lot of problems

I didn't really feel playing as much today as I did yesterday (prolly the dankover) -- however, I did find a better way to lay out the base (cross fashion). I put the vehicles depot in the same spot though, and figured out a better way of doing that too -- cause turns out my idea of building vp1 and science won't work because it won't use the mechanical parts it creates for the vp1 or le1 -- and there's also no way to sort out only *some* (like 20-50%) of the mp and loop it back into the assembler. I'm going to instead put a balancer on the ground and send any surplus of e1 or mp up the hill to get made into le1 and vp1.

there was also a fatal flaw in my core base setup where I'm not storing slabs at all... the plan was to put the storage at the end of the production line and I'll probably do that in the future, but I'm considering to redesign the core a bit so I can store slabs and also have a loopback belt. probably to do this, I'm going to need to move the bricks line back a bit. for now though, I have a solution of storing moving iron over and storing it in 2x360 boxes right next to 2x360 boxes of slabs stored right next to the iron (facing the opposite direction). I'm not happy with the setup cause the boxes are fed only by two mixers (so max 96/m with t3 mixers) -- which is less than ideal. I'd really like to store my slag in the form of retaining walls rathar than throwing it on the ground.

one good thing about it is I redesigned the back electronics area and I have a lot of space now (where the diesel generators and fuel station is). it works pretty well, but I need to think about how to get diesel into the front of the base. I'll probably ignore that and just setup the 8x adv diesel in front of the shipyard like in p- -- fed from the cargo depot just to the left of it. that way I have some diesel in the front *and* the back. the other thing is, with the new cross base layout I'm setting up, I've got a way to get diesel (or this first revision, just fertilizer) up to the farms. we'll see.

I included a (ref) save, but it's going to be nothing like that. I explored a lot of what I *don't* want to do -- like putting the tech labs inside the base instead of up on the hill. lol.

I also learned that growth boost is pretty inefficient in early game. I was wasting tons of unity and significantly reducing how much construction/deconstruction I could do. growth boost (1u/m) gives me about 2-3 pops but if I "buy" pops on the world map, they cost 0.25/each -- which is twice as cheap meanwhile my population is still low. I remembered when I would turn on growth boost on b- and I'd get like 60 pops/m. I guess after a certain population, it becomes cheaper to use growth boost, but I'm not sure when that is yet. still learning :)

---

in general, I want to also note how differently I play when sober vs stoned. it's an entirely different game honestly, and I reason about it very differently. some things are quite effortless when I'm stoned, but other things are super difficult (like remembering to look at other parts of the base). the experience is fun (especially with music -- seriah was blowing my mind yesterday), but I really like being sober. I'm much sharper and I can "see" (feel) the problems coming in at a distance much easier.

you know a long time ago, I complained about COI saying that I find the micromanagement aspect of the game difficult because I can't *feel* the problems coming like I can in real-life. I think though, that I'm starting to develop the capacity to "see" the problems now in COI like I do in programming

short story: when I was a programmer, I found out that I could always feel where the bug was if I developed the capacity. I found that whenever I encountered a problem, I could (I didn't call it that, then) use "conceptual-viewing" (a method of looking into anything experienced conceptually to figure out the conceptual interaction that produces any physical effect, including bugs and relationships things), and found out that I could use it to locate the bug. I had an intutitive sence (just by "looking") at the problem conceptually/emotionally of where the bug is -- and if I couldn't decode the context to decode the concept correctly, I would get ideas on where to look. it taught me that every problem has a solution, and it's only me that's unable to feel my way toward the originating concept (and develop my own solution), or to "see" the solution immediately.

I started to do this in some of the bug reports I put on the github. in the description, if I could get a sense of the origin of the problem, I included my thoughts on what I think is the cause of the bug. it's a super useful skill to have. it's the same skill that I use to play COI. it's all feeling based, and has no visuals (which is funny because I use visual words to describe my intuition -- and I believe its processed in the visual part of the brain where we're greatly aided by visuals to "see" statistics). graphs are great liars to us because when looking at them, we "feel" or have an intuitive sense of what is the problem (correlation isn't causation), and it's possible to train the brain (as I've done), to be able to "predict" and subsequently "see" what is the most likely explanation for anything. the *received* idea, is then processed through my own logic and concepts, so it sounds and feels like my own idea, but I can tell you for sure, its a *received* idea, as all emotions/concepts are.

### 2023-01-04 23:05 - received ideas

in the last entry, I said that all emotions are received. I was going to write that all physicality and emotions/concepts are received, but I felt like it would require some explaining and I wanted to end it there. it's pretty easy too see. your body is an array of sensors that are *receiving* data from the environment. the brain then composes those signals into physical sensations. if you watch a slow-motion of someone getting hit or something, the delayed reaction on their face shows you that it takes a bit of time for the signal to travel from the sensor on the skin all the way up to the brain -- so it's pretty easy to see why physicality is *received* -- and only very few people performing esoteric thing claim to be transmitting physicality. there are practicioners of chi that can seemingly allow another person to feel a sensation in their body without touching them. I argue that the force that they're using to cause a sensation in someone else's body is the same force that the emotional/conceptual runs on (chi/vril), so that's an interesting case in itself -- but the main concept here is that we *receive* concepts and emotions -- but from where, one might wonder.

the way that it works for me ... well, just imagine that you have an eternal part of you (call it a soul, spirit, or higher self -- doesn't matter), and that part of you perceives much much more than you can see in your physical body -- and that's because the eternal part of you is a vibrational system and so doesn't rely on images, sound, or other finite vibrations like the body does. in fact, because you can imagine that all things are vibrational (including your position in both space and time), the eternal part of you is capable of perceiving things that you're becoming vibrationally similar to (attracting), and so it can see *anything* -- and I mean literally *anything*. there are no limits. all you have to do is tune into whatever you want, and then decode the signal into something that your brain can interpret into something (image, sensation, knowing, intuition, etc.) it's all the same thing: vibrations in the medium we call physical (which I'll define as basically 0Hz to UV -- as x-rays pass through the body, and so we can only receive them in part). it's a good thing that all physicality is received, because otherwise nothing we do would have any effect on anything.

as such, the fact that all physicality, emotions and concepts are received illuminates the myth of epimetheus forgetting to give humankind an identifyable trait or instinct -- and so therefore we make tools to interact with our environment. so think about it -- if physicality and emotion are all received, then that means that the eternal part of you interacts with physicality by proxy -- through the body. so, when mcluhan talked about us interacting with mediums, and it's the mediums where we transmit concepts through images, words, sounds, etc. the physical body is already itself quite a powerful tool for interacting with the physical medium.

I had a brain haemorrhage when I was 16 and I can tell with certainty from that experience, that each of us is interacting with the brain's concept, which really is a *model* of the environment. many concepts continue on with a person through death, but the new body often times isn't capable of tuning into those concepts yet, so most of us in early years are using physical conditions to aid in tuning into those concepts again. they are eternal, and it's only our ablity to tune to them. if you have any knowledge of OBEs NDEs or remote viewing, it should be fairly obvious that all physicality is received (cause how else would any of those by possible).

so then, if it's only a matter of tuning, why not use that capability to our advantage? seems like a no-brainer for me, but I understand the resistance to it. the capability to tune into anything is basically locked behind emotions, because emotions is what you're tuning to. if you've traveled before or been around particularly energetic people, you'll notice the earth and nature in general feels different in different places, and so do people. these are all mediums that exist and they affect perception (like, notice how in a forest or somewhere in nature, mental thought is different because you feel different -- or just do some drugs :) and notice how thinking changes, because the signals are getting modified).

your body is a tool. thanks epimetheus :)

---

anyway, this set of saves are from last night. I think I'm probably going to delete a few of them because the last half-hour or so started to go pretty terribly (ref: LEFTL-2022-07-10), so I'll try and start over a little bit earlier. the main thing I accomplished is moving maintenance and vp1 (both use e1 and mp1), which are quite nearby. so I'll probably do that again. this time, I'm starting with LEFTL-2022-08-12 instead.

also, I'm gonna move these entries out to their own directory, "clogs" -- short for captain's logs -- and just link to them from here -- cause I'm kinda liking to wax philosophical while playing a game. there is quite a lot that one can learn from theirself while playing this game, and I want to start sharing some of the ideas, which is why I'm taking the time to lay out some of the foundational ideas which I'll need in place to be able to build on top of.

### 2023-01-05 00:45 - why get philosophical instead of just talking only about the game?

I'm quite aware of others interacting with me. I experience others' thoughts in the form of feelings and concepts. they're just as meaningful as forboding feeling that something is good or bad is about to happen. for me, they happen in real-time in response to me -- so, for example, I'm writing this before I've committed the previous log, yet in the interim time between then and now, I've received concepts in response to what I wrote. I attribute this to be because concepts are eternal, like you (plato calls them the world of ideas/ideals), where the idea has it's physical manifestation imperfect renderings of the concept into physicality. this is great because it allows a concept to have infinite variations to it depending on the conditions of the environment it's instantiated into. just let that sink in a moment: all concepts are eternal, just like you are. death, is simply the inability for "you" to continue to tune into the body (it's too feeble or critical components have failed).

the other major reason is, I've been thinking about the future of this game, where it's going because I find this game extremely interesting because on its surface it's exactly like running a tech team. different things are being produced in different locations, and it takes organisation to get the different components into the same spot to create something bigger. when I worked on a tech team, I gave up the position as CTO because I didn't see the team as a set of units that produce more advanced units. I see people as conceptual beings, and for me, I can't program something that I don't feel -- and I approacrhed the mangement of the team that way. however, the CEO wanted spreadsheets and things like that from me. I know how to do spreadsheets but I equated them with BS manageent like bill lumberg in "office space" -- needing a certain amount of TPS reports from peter. I didn't think that was a successful strategy to make a *social* network (I worked for tuenti as one of the founders but left after only a few months).

I have repented from my ways of hating to see people and tasks as *just* units for a number of reasons (which would take some time to elaborate on), and so because I've found the value in a unit based approach to life, since then, I find my approach to life is considerably different than most. yes, normally I see everything as a spectrum (much like a child does), so talking about emotions in terms of units in reference to defined tasks like programming and production is a very interesting challenge for me. all of reality runs on this energy (chi/vril), so get used to me talking about it because it's the invisible force which my brain (but probably yours too) makes its models of reality out of, and so concepts and emotion is key to understanding perception and the nature of reality (as experineced through the physical).

I really enjoy the challenge that this game provides me, and just playing it has completely transformed how I see the world. when I first saw it, I immediately wanted to download it. I can't remember if I doubted my intuition or what happened now at first -- just a quick note -- conceptual people like me often times remember things conceptually very different than how they "really happened" -- so just bear with any "inaccuracies" that creep in. the inaccuracies are actually part of changing your trajectory on the timeline (there are infinite ways to arrive to the present, and the direction/vector is the trajectory and determines how your going). nobody can change their position in the present, but by conceptualising your past differently you change your trajectory into the future. derailed.

so, I can't remember if I originally doubted my intuition or whatever, but when I first loaded up the game, I was *sooooo* confused. I went on to youtube to see some videos of others playing the game and found JD (somewhere around his housing crisis, if I remember right). I paused the video and copied his designs cause I was just having such a terrible time trying to figure out how to conceptualise this game. the worst was the adv diesel setup. there are so many liquids and thingsx going so many places -- then I have to figure out where to put the sulfur... his "waste not want not" setup got me going, and it took me at least a few days before I could put together my own version of it. seriously, I learn like a child does -- but I have adult vocabulary to talk about it, so I'm a bit like the rosetta stone of consciousness and mentation. having to relearn how to use my left-side and not having an imagination, forces me to learn everything conceptually.

now that I've built a concept of the game, it appears easy to me. I told JD on his discord that I found the game impossible to play when I'm stoned (cause things get too abstract to be able to interact physically very easily) -- and so you can look at my save games of my stoned expitidion a few days ago (I ate a lot of resin), that I feel confident that I've built a good enough model of the game now to be able to keep the base production going positive even while stoned. that event really gave me tons of confidence in myself -- and with the additional test of writing here and feeling the reactions to what I wrote, really gives me confidence that I actually have an audience... welcome :)

you'll find I'm a bit intense at times. that's partially why I'm just writing these here, because I only get non-tangible feedback to my writings and playing and don't have to interact with the audience like a real streamer does. I kinda like the distance, honestly. it gives me time to think. I'm definitely not hiding my identity (as a simple google search with some of the data I put in this entry will produce news articles with my name and identity in it). I also know for sure my identity is quite well exposed in some of my other repositories on github (my phone number may even be in there somewhere too).

I really have no secrets, so therefore I have no barriers to talk about *anything* -- and I really mean anything. I regularly intermingle concepts associated with spirituality and consciousness with things like logic and emotion. they all appear as understandable and recognisable to me. as such, I've found that my intensity and telepathic interaction with people has alienated me from many. it's not that people don't want to listen to me. it's just that they don't really want to interact with me so much directly. as a result, I've begun to express myself in more and more ways that is uni-directional. many people know where I am and how to find me, so it's not for inability to contact me that I am alienated, but probably because humankind at this time still sees emotion (a topic I use a lot) as something foreign, unknown, and therfore scary. tech teams are designed around units still not concepts. oh yes, you can email me anytime at my github email: mechanicofthesequence@gmail.com

oof, this is long now... time to play the game... lol.

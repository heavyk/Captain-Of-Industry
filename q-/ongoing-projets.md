# q- ongoing projects

while playing, I keep notes in a separate document, so I thought I would organise and commit it. this is, by no means an exhaustive list. as I finish designing and testing projects, I'll put them into a different directory, including pictures and stuff with the grid on for my own reference (I can't remember exactly how all of the designs go)

### projects

#### 8x diesel power plant

- setup 4x basic distillers (2 units) for 3 boilers, outputs 144 water
- 2 pumps, 2 dumps
- build 8x adv diesel rigging + 4x sws (stage 2 only)
  - inputs:
    - 144 steam
    - 432 crude
  - outputs:
    - 288 light oil (minus 36 for 1 boiler)
    - 48 heavy oil (all used in 2 boilers)
    - 48 amonia
    - 96 water
- pipe in light/heavy oil to boilers
- excess light oil (396) can be burnt in the flare or it can be used to create power
  - up to 11 boilers worth of light oil can be excess
    - which is 13.2MW of power, 22 t1 turbines
    - 528 water, which is 4 basic desal units
  - obviously, the the amount of power generated will be directly proportional to the amount of diesel consumed
  - the remining power will be supplemented by coal power and diesel generators

### now

- build (in increments) the 8x diesel power plant
- put t3 labs next to iron dump

### asap

- (limiting mp1, and cp3) add another naked (without belts) steel smelter as soon as space is available
- (limiting e1) expand copper smelter (will take a while, cause there's a lot of dirt).

### soonish..

- get rid of iron dump (it was temporary because I needed space to expand steel)

### later...

- convert all dirt on inner platform into bricks

### eventually...
